# FutureTST Hourly Streamflow Forecasting Demo

Multi-step hourly streamflow forecasting on CAMELS-H data with FutureTST, an
encoder-decoder Transformer that conditions on known future meteorological
inputs. The pipeline covers preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Layout

```
futuretstdemo/
├── run_forecast.sh                  # runs the full pipeline
├── data/
│   └── camelsh_demo.parquet         # demo data: 5 basins, hourly, 1990-2022
├── data_processing/

```

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r diffusion_forecast/requirements.txt
```

A GPU is expected (`--device cuda` by default).

## Run

```bash
bash run_forecast.sh
```

Defaults: 168-hour input window, 18-hour forecast horizon, 200 training epochs
with early stopping (patience 20).

Common variations:

```bash
bash run_forecast.sh --pred_len 24                     # 24-hour horizon
bash run_forecast.sh --windows 336 --pred_len 48       # longer window
bash run_forecast.sh --parquet /path/to/your.parquet   # different data
bash run_forecast.sh --basins "03550000 03453500"      # subset of basins
bash run_forecast.sh --epochs 5                        # quick smoke test
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 bash run_forecast.sh            # pick a GPU
```

## Data format

The input parquet has one row per (basin, hour) with columns:

- `basin_id`, `Time`
- 11 dynamic meteorological features: `CAPE, CRainf_frac, LWdown, PotEvap, PSurf, Qair, Rainf, SWdown, Tair, Wind_E, Wind_N`
- 24 static basin attributes: `p_mean, pet_mean, aridity, ...` (see `STATIC_VARS` in `preprocess_camelsh_forecast.py`)
- target: `Q_camelsh_obs_norm` (area-normalized streamflow)
- `latitude, longitude` (used for the basin distance matrix)

Preprocessing adds 24/72/168-hour cumulative rainfall, mean air temperature,
and cumulative potential evaporation, for 44 input features in total.

Date splits (editable at the top of `preprocess_camelsh_forecast.py`):

- Train: 1997-01-01 to 2018-12-31
- Val:   1995-01-01 to 1996-12-31
- Test:  2019-01-01 to 2022-12-31

## Outputs

- `diffusion_forecast/output/pred/tst.npy` — normalized sliding-window predictions (stride 24 by default)
- `diffusion_forecast/output/denorm/` — denormalized prediction vs observation CSVs and per-basin metrics (NSE, KGE, RMSE, ...)
- `diffusion_forecast/output/figure/` — prediction vs observation plots per basin
- `diffusion_forecast/results/` — model checkpoints
